    <section class = "header"><h1>What would a world without police look like?</h1></section>
    
    <!-- Vision Statement -->
    <h2>The Vision</h2> 
    <p> Our cities currently choose to pour tens of millions of dollars into already-bloated police budgets, reinforcing a system of punishment and brokenness, instead of addressing the root causes of crime. We treat policing as the obvious way to treat society’s issues, but what if we looked deeper than that? I offer up this data visualization as a means of reimagining how to distribute city budgets to building a more beautiful, radical, and resilient community. </p>

    <p> This tree map represents the Oakland Police Department’s overtime budget for the next fiscal year, a whopping $34 million. [1] Each panel represents a proportion of that budget that could instead fully fund a community-centered program, based on the budgets for existing programs in Oakland as well as across the United States (a more detailed methodology is available lower on the page). Hover over each panel to explore another possibility, and click on it to get some more specific data. Scroll further down this page to see a more detailed analysis with references. </p>

    <p> I created this map to push back against the idea that we are engaging in “data-driven policymaking.” “Copaganda” leads us to believe that more police equates to less crime, but the data shows that OPD fails to meaningfully impact crime rates even with increased overtime. [2] [3] The alternatives I’ve chosen have repeatedly proven to be tremendously effective at not just reducing crime, but preventing it entirely, by meeting residents’ basic needs. Yet often, these are the programs that are begging for scraps while police budgets continue to balloon. It is not only morally imperative but an economic and data-proven necessity that we reallocate funding towards programs that actually address the root causes of violent crime. [4] </p>

    <p> If anything in this chart sounds outlandish to you, I challenge you to consider truly absurd things that have been normalized in our world - such as children being shot in their classrooms, people living in tents on the streets, and entire populations being subjected to state-funded genocide. If there’s something not mentioned on here that you think would be an even greater dream, I encourage you to hold onto that vision (and play around with the interactive visualization tool below the analysis on this page). Let’s keep pushing one another to dream bigger, outside of the carceral capitalist “data-driven” systems we currently live under. </p>

    <p class = "postscript">  *For the simplicity of this visualization, I am focusing just on overtime, but this sentiment applies to the militarization, oversurveillance, and entire concept of policing as well. </p>

    <div id="animation-container"></div>

    <!-- Methodology -->
    <h2>The Methodology</h2>
    <p> My numbers are based off of the analysis I had done on the budgets and results for OPD and alternative programs both in Oakland and across the U.S. Acknowledging that different cities have different population sizes and different needs, I give ballpark estimates of what is possible to achieve with mere fractions of the police budget. However, there is an element of "fuck-all" that I am embracing. My numbers are not exact, the math is not to the perfect decimal point, sometimes I decided to give a program an extra $1 million just because I can. If OPD can claim they need $34,000,000 in overtime next year because they feel like it, then I can claim that we should give 2% of that to the program that gives kids living in food deserts free lunch over the summer. There is no such thing as truly objective or neutral data, nor should there be. Data exists in the context of the world around us, and it is important to acknowledge that. Even if the math worked out that giving cops more money makes them more effective, I would rather feed a kid lunch than give a cop a gun. </p> 
    
    <!-- Interactive Component -->
    <h2>Now it's your turn</h2>
    <p>My dream budget might not be your dream budget. My data clearly reflects the biases and priorities that I hold, but that does not mean it is the one objective answer (or that any such one objective truth exists!). Every city has its own unique needs and every community member has their own unique perspective on what change needs to happen.
      I encourage you to create your own dream city budget with your most outlandish dreams using the generator below. Imagine if you had a reliable bus system that could take you across your whole city end to end in 20 minutes, or if your child had a magical pencil box that never ran out of school supplies. Tap into your wildest imagination and ask yourself what type of city you would build if you had all of the money and resources in the world.
